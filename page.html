<h2><center>Sillycon vally: where you weep for water</center></h2>
<p1 style="text-align:left;">Bengaluru, dotted with tech companies that employ thousands of software engineers from across the country and abroad, is in the throes of the worst water crisis in about four decades, with no rain in sight.<br>
When the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) banned drinking water for non-potable use almost a month ago, it was seen as a knee-jerk reaction to a problem whose intensity would soon end.<br>

Nearly a month later, however, solutions to the water crisis remain a mirage. Residents keep exploring options to find non-potable water for washing cars and courtyards and even gardening.<br>
If anyone uses potable water for, say, watering plants, the BWSSB promptly fines Rs 5,000 for each first-time violation. Each subsequent violation costs Rs 5,000 plus an
additional Rs 500.<br>

A BWSSB source said that they have so far collected more than Rs 1.5 lakh in penalties from across the city. Residents have now started limiting the use of precious Cauvery water.

The oppressive heat and the driest March in many years have added to the woes of the parched city.

A supplier of potable water in upscale Indiranagar in the city told this newspaper that 6,000 litres now cost Rs 800, although the government had capped the price at Rs 600 for ferrying a tanker within a radius of 5km and Rs 750 between 5km and 10km.<br>
The water board kept a close watch on recreation centres and hotels where Holi celebrations were held last week. The authorities prohibited using Cauvery water and bore well water for pool parties and rain dances, a Holi staple in a city where the festival is a recent import with migrant population from the north.

The safest option for many for washing cars and utility areas and gardening is wastewater pumped out by reverse osmosis (RO) water filters in the kitchen. Even so, many worry about getting fined, since only a lab test can prove that the water is indeed flushed out by RO filters.

Apartment complexes with sewage treatment plants are allowed to use treated water to clean the common areas and for gardening. Some apartments built with enough foresight have already been using treated wastewater for flushing toilets.<br>
The BWSSB has allowed builders to purchase treated wastewater from the agency or apartment complexes fitted with sewage treatment plants.

BWSSB chairman V. Ram Prasath Manohar said builders had sought more than 60 lakh litres of treated water and the demand was expected to spike in the coming days.<br>

<h3><center>Knights power to top with crushing victory over Delhi Capitals</center></h3>
<p2 style="text-align:center;">By the time Capitals captain Rishabh Pant (55 off 24 balls) unleashed his pyrotechnics and toyed with Venkatesh Iyer by slamming him for 28 in the 12th over — also recording his second straight fifty of the season — the Knights had practically wrapped up the game Just stand-and-deliver stuff. That was good enough for Sunil Narine (85 off 39 balls) to blast the Delhi Capitals attack and lay a fantastic platform for the Kolkata Knight Riders’ mammoth 106-run victory in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday.<br>
Courtesy Narine’s blitz, along with contributions from 18-year-old Angkrish Raghuvanshi (54 off 27 balls), Andre Russell (41 off 19 balls) and Rinku Singh (26 off 8 balls), the Knight Riders piled on 272/7 after electing to bat first. They batted their opponents out of the game as all that the Capitals could manage was 166 in 17.2 overs.With the batters having done more than half the job, the bowlers ensured they did not mess up. Mitchell Starc finally registered his name in the wickets column with the important scalps of Mitchell Marsh and David Warner, while his new-ball partner Vaibhav Arora (Impact Player for Raghuvanshi) accounted for Prithvi Shaw and the Capitals’ Impact Player Abishek Porel (for pacer Khaleel Ahmed). All four wickets fell inside the Powerplay.Like Rajasthan Royals, the Knight Riders too have now won three on the trot to reclaim the top position in the standings by virtue of a far superior net run rate. At present, what could be a bit of a concern for KKR is pacer Harshit Rana’s shoulder injury.<br>

Earlier, on a belter of a pitch, Narine just cleared his front leg and had fun, unleashing shots to almost all corners of the ground. With the ground being on the smaller side, Narine, who has had success earlier opening in T20s, took full advantage of that aspect as well and gave a fine exhibition of his hand-eye coordination to make it nightmarish for the Capitals bowlers.
Along the way, he also registered his highest T20 score.<br>
At the same time, Pant’s delay in taking a review not just gave Narine a lifeline but also hurt the Capitals very badly. On 24 then, Narine tried to swing across the line off Ishant Sharma in the fourth over and it took an edge off his blade. After intervention from Marsh, Pant did signal for the DRS only to be told by the on-field umpire that time was over. Replays did show the edge off Narine’s bat.

After such a costly miss, Pant again bungled on taking a review, when KKR captain Shreyas Iyer — on 3 then — edged one off Rasikh Salam in the 15th over.<br>
